**Over 35 practical recipes to explore ensemble machine learning techniques using Python**

## What is this book about?
Ensemble modeling is an approach used to improve the performance of machine learning models. It combines two or more similar or dissimilar machine learning algorithms to deliver superior intellectual powers. This book will help you to implement popular machine learning algorithms to cover different paradigms of ensemble machine learning such as boosting, bagging, and stacking.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand how to use machine learning algorithms for regression and classification problems
* Implement ensemble techniques such as averaging, weighted averaging, and max-voting
* Get to grips with advanced ensemble methods, such as bootstrapping, bagging, and stacking
* Use Random Forest for tasks such as classification and regression
* Implement an ensemble of homogeneous and heterogeneous machine learning algorithms
